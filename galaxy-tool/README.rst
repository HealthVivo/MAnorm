Galaxy Wrapper for MAnorm
=========================

Introduction
------------

ChIP-Seq is widely used to characterize genome-wide binding patterns of
transcription factors and other chromatin-associated proteins. Although
comparison of ChIP-Seq data sets is critical for understanding cell
type-dependent and cell state-specific binding, and thus the study of
cell-specific gene regulation, few quantitative approaches have been
developed.

Here, we present a simple and effective method, MAnorm, for quantitative
comparison of ChIP-Seq data sets describing transcription factor binding
sites and epigenetic modifications. The quantitative binding differences
inferred by MAnorm showed strong correlation with both the changes in
expression of target genes and the binding of cell type-specific
regulators.
